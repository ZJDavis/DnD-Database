# DnD-Database
A database for storing data for Dungeons and Dragons or any similar tabletop RPG.

## Note: The data to populate these tables is largely protected by the copyright owners, Wizards of the Coast, so I'm not including the data to fill out this database. Free data can be found on various sites including
[5e SRD](https://www.5esrd.com/)
[5th SRD](https://5thsrd.org/)
and the official data can be found at [DnD Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) where much is freely available but some data requires membership.
